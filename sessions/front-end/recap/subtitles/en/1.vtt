Hi, everyone.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm Guil, and in this course, we're gonna
learn about the wonders of CSS or

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.740 align:middle line:84%
cascading style sheets.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the core technologies for
designing and

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.390 align:middle line:84%
building websites and applications.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So, no matter what kind of website or

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.860 align:middle line:90%
web app you wanna build, you'll have to
use CSS.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:90%
You might have already used CSS, or you've
seen it in action in previous courses.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:84%
In this course,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:90%
we're gonna dive a little deeper into many
of the core concepts of CSS.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:90%
To get familiar with the most important
part of css,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:90%
we'll build a simple landing page for the
beautiful city of Lake Tahoe, California.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:90%
First we'll learn the different ways we
can apply CSS to a page.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Then we'll add those nice design layers
with basic selectors,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
common CSS properties and values.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:90%
We'll even use some of the latest features
in CSS.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:90%
By the end of this course, you'll be a few
steps closer to being a CSS pro.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Then let's get started.
